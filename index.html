            <p>I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through<br>
                I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah)<br>
                'Cause I love you, yeah<br>
                It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold<br>
                But tonight, I'm gon' let you know<br>
                Let me tell the truth<br>
                Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah<br>
                <br>
                You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
                You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
                You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night<br>
                I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time<br>
                I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love<br>
                I try to find a reason to pull us apart<br>
                It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
                And I know that you're worth it<br>
                I can't walk away, oh<br>
                <br>
                Even though we're goin' through it<br>
                And it makes you feel alone<br>
                Just know that I would die for you<br>
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
                The distance and the time between us<br>
                It'll never change my mind 'cause<br>
                Baby, I would die for you<br>
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Say)<br>
                <br>
                I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through<br>
                But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you<br>
                Just don't blame me, too, yeah<br>
                'Cause I can't take this pain forever<br>
                And you won't find no one that's better<br>
                'Cause I'm right for you, babe<br>
                I think I'm right for you, babe<br>
                <br>
                You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
                You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
                It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
                And I know that you're worth it<br>
                I can't walk away, oh<br>

                It'll never change my mind 'cause<br>
                Baby, I would die for you, uh<br>
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
                <br>
                I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
                Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
                I'm just sayin', yeah<br>
                I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
                Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
                Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na<br>

                Just know that I would die for you<br>
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>

                It'll never change my mind 'cause<br>
